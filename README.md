****Project File****

1. Source Code Notebook 

Description: This Jupyter Notebook contains the complete framework for predicting football match outcomes in the English Premier League (EPL) using machine learning algorithms. It covers data pre-processing, feature selection, and feature engineering across 30 seasons (1993/1994 to 2022/2023). The notebook implements Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest algorithms. After training, the models are evaluated on separate testing data to measure their performance.

2. Project Interface File:

Filename: Football Match Prediction_Project Interface.zip

Description: This folder contains the interface to demonstrate predictions using the Random Forest model, identified as the best performing model.

***How to Use***
