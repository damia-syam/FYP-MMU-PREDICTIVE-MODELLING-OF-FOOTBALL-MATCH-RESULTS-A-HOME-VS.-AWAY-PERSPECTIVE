**About This Notebook:**

This Python Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file demonstrates the designed framework to predict football match outcomes in the English Premier League (EPL) using machine learning algorithms. The initial phase begins with data pre-processing, feature selection, and feature engineering to ensure dataset cleanliness across 30 seasons (1993/1994 season to 2022/2023). After preprocessing, machine learning algorithms—Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest—are implemented. These models are trained on the dataset to identify patterns and relationships. Subsequently, the trained models are tested using separate testing data to evaluate their performance.

**Project Interface:**
